\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that has to include the variables \code{tier_no} (the
number of the tier starting from the top tier no. 1) and \code{player_id} (the
player's MLBAM/Savant ID). If data includes the variable \code{tier_rank},
these ranks will be used within each tier. Otherwise, if \code{presort = FALSE},
the function will assume that data is already sorted and if \code{presort = TRUE},
teams will be sorted alphabetically within tiers.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot. If \code{NULL}, it will be omitted.}

\item{subtitle}{The subtitle of the plot. If \code{NULL}, it will be omitted.}

\item{caption}{The caption of the plot. If \code{NULL}, it will be omitted.}

\item{tier_desc}{A named vector consisting of the tier descriptions. The names
must equal the tier numbers from \code{tier_no}}

\item{presort}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the function assumes that the teams
are already sorted within the tiers. Will otherwise sort alphabetically.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha channel of the logos, i.e. transparency level, as a
numerical value between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1}

\item{width}{The desired width of the logo in \code{npc} (Normalised Parent Coordinates). A typical size is 0.1.}

\item{no_line_below_tier}{Vector of tier numbers. The function won't draw tier
separation lines below these tiers. This is intended to be used for tiers
that shall be combined (see examples).}

\item{devel}{Determines if headshots shall be rendered. If \code{FALSE} (the default),
headshots will be rendered on each run. If \code{TRUE} the player ids will be
plotted instead of the logos. This is much faster and helps with the plot
development.}

\item{background_color}{Background color for the plot. Defaults to "#1e1e1e"}

\item{line_color}{Line color for the plot. Defaults to "#e0e0e0"}

\item{title_color}{Text color for the title. Defaults to "white"}

\item{subtitle_color}{Text color the the subtitle. Defaults to "#8e8e93"}

\item{caption_color}{Text color the the caption. Defaults to be equal to the subtitle}

\item{tier_label_color}{Text color for the tier labels. Defaults to be equal to the title}

\item{headshot_type}{"main" or "dot" headshots? Defaults to "main"}

\item{na_headshot_to_logo}{Should NA/non-matches return the MLB logo instead of a grayed out blank headshot? Defaults to \code{TRUE}}
